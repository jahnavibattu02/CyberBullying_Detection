# CyberBullying_Detection
An End to End social media like platform with SQLlite3

Introducing the Cyberbullying Detection System, an advanced platform developed using Streamlit and SQLite3 to detect and prevent cyberbullying in a Twitter-like environment. With this system, users can report any instances of cyberbullying, and the system will analyze the tweet's content to detect any potential bullying behavior.

Upon detection of bullying behavior, the system automatically notifies the system administrator, who can then view the tweet and take appropriate action, such as removing the user from the system or issuing a warning. This system helps to create a safe and welcoming online environment where everyone can feel comfortable and protected.

The system also incorporates a database that stores users' details, including their tweets and reported instances of cyberbullying. This database helps to track and identify patterns of bullying behavior, allowing the system to learn and improve over time.

This system is a significant step forward in preventing cyberbullying and promoting positive online behavior. With its advanced technology and user-friendly interface, users can have confidence in the system's accuracy and reliability.

The Cyberbullying Detection System is a perfect solution for social media platforms and other online communities that want to create a safe and inclusive environment for all users. With this system, users can feel confident that their online experience will be free from bullying and harassment, creating a positive and uplifting environment for all.
